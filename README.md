# [Using Types](https://youtu.be/BwuLxPH8IDs?t=2486)

TS provides many types to JS
TS enabled you to write your own types

Number - same in TS and JS

String - same in TS and JS

Boolean - TS only knows true or false, NOT truthy or falsy

# [Type Assignment and Type Inference](https://youtu.be/BwuLxPH8IDs?t=3750)

Assigning a type to a variable is not good practice for example

`let number1: number = 5` is bad practice

If you create it in an unassigned way then it's better for example

```
let number1: number;

number1 = '5'

```

Then it would complain because it's not a number
